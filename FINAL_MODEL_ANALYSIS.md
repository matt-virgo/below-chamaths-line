### 2. **Feature Engineering Value**
- **V1's comprehensive approach** (58 features) consistently outperformed selective approaches
- **Programmer detection features** confirmed algorithmic data generation but added noise
- **Raw features performed 23.3% worse** than engineered features

### 3. **Model Architecture Insights**

- **Ensemble approaches failed** when base models had large performance gaps

## 🧠 Domain Knowledge Analysis

### Interview-Derived Insights
Our analysis of employee interviews revealed sophisticated business rules:

**Kevin's Optimization Patterns:**
- 5-day trips with 180+ miles/day and <$100/day spending = "sweet spot"
- Efficiency bonuses for 180-220 miles per day
- Vacation penalties for 8+ days with high spending

**Lisa's Accounting Observations:**
- 5-day trips almost always get bonuses
- Medium-high receipts ($600-800) get favorable treatment
- Small receipts penalized vs taking base per diem

**System Behavior Patterns:**
- Non-linear mileage calculations with tiered rates
- Spending optimization ranges vary by trip length
- Complex interaction effects between duration, distance, and spending

### Heuristic Rules Experiment Results
**TabPFN + Heuristics: $115.53 MAE (-106.4% performance)**

**Key Finding:** Explicit business rules **dramatically hurt performance**, revealing that:
- TabPFN already captures these patterns implicitly
- Foundation models learn business rules from data patterns
- Manual rule layering interferes with learned representations

## 📊 Outlier Analysis Insights

### Statistical Outlier Detection
- **100 outliers identified** (10% of dataset) using Isolation Forest
- **No outliers detected** by Z-score or IQR methods
- **Strong correlation** between statistical outliers and high prediction errors

### Outlier Categories
1. **🔴 Ultra Low Activity (10 samples)**: <50 miles/day + <$30/day
2. **🟠 Unbalanced Effort (17 samples)**: High receipts/low miles or vice versa  
3. **🟡 Extreme Durations (66 samples)**: 1 day or 14+ day trips
4. **🚨 High Error Correlation**: 4 of top 15 high-error samples were statistical outliers

### Data Quality Impact
- Outliers represent **edge cases** or potential **data entry errors**
- They make pattern learning difficult across all model types
- Clear targets for **data cleaning** in production systems

## 🔬 Technical Deep Dives

### Feature Engineering Evolution
- **V1**: Comprehensive 58-feature approach with mathematical transformations
- **V2**: Added 20 programmer detection features (Fibonacci, primes, powers of 2)
- **V3**: Selective 20-feature approach combining best of V1 + V2
- **Raw**: Just 3 input variables (trip_duration, miles, receipts)

**Result:** V1's comprehensive approach consistently outperformed selective strategies.

### Neural Architecture Exploration
- **V1**: Multiple architectures with basic optimization
- **V4**: Advanced architectures with skip connections, multi-head attention, sophisticated scheduling
- **Champions**: Extended training with no early stopping

**Result:** V1's simpler approach with comprehensive features beat complex V4 architectures.

### Foundation Model Testing
- **TabPFN**: Zero-shot performance on engineered features
- **TabPFN Extensions**: Automatic post-hoc ensembling (still training)
- **Unsupervised TabPFN**: Outlier detection capabilities

**Result:** Foundation models achieved best performance with minimal effort.
